rmt-054 054.xml  Contains a character reference to a C0 control character (form-feed) in an entity value. This will be legal (in XML 1.1) when the entity declaration is parsed, but what about when it is used? According to the grammar in the CR spec, it should be illegal (because the replacement text must match "content"), but this is probably not intended. This will be fixed in the PR version. ; 12:8 Unexpected entity: e
